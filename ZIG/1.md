## `const` for Constants

- Use `const` to create constants with unchangeable values.
- Constants are declared with the `const` keyword.
- Once assigned, their values cannot be modified.
- This ensures predictability and safety.

Example:
```zig
const x = 1234;
const y = "Hello, Zig!";
```

## `var` for Mutable Variables

- Utilize `var` for variables whose values can change.
- Declare variables with `var` when you need mutability.
- You can modify the values of variables declared with `var`.

Example:
```zig
var count: i32 = 0;
count += 1;
```

## Initialization is Mandatory

- All variables, whether constants or variables, must be initialized before use.
- Attempting to use an uninitialized variable will result in a compile-time error.

Example:
```zig
var temperature: f64 = 0.0; // Correct initialization
temperature = 25.5; // Updating the variable
```

## Handling Undefined Values

- When you need an uninitialized variable, use `undefined`.
- Be cautious when using `undefined`, as it can represent unpredictable values.
- In debug mode, Zig writes `0xaa` bytes to undefined memory for debugging purposes.

Example:
```zig
var data: [10]u8 = undefined;
// Use `data` with caution as it contains undefined values.
```
